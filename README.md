## Stretch Goals

The exercises in the following links will help you get more practice with CSS selectors, CSS Flexbox, and optionally Grid.

### [Exercise 11](./workshop/exercise-10/)

Go back to exercise 10 and make the button do a 360deg rotation when it bounces

![exercise-10 bonus goal](././lecture/assets/ex-10-goal-bonus.gif)

- Use the syntax `transform:scale() rotate()` in your keyframe

### [Exercise 12](./workshop/exercise-12-stretch/) - NO flexbox!

The very first exercise had us build this:

![exercise-1 goal](././lecture/assets/ex-1-goal.png)

For fun, try and build this _without_ using flexbox. No `display: flex` allowed.

You will need to use `calc()` and `vh` units for this.

Example use: `min-height: calc(10vh + 200px);`
